There is a new requirement to implement a new feature Fan Wallet Pass for customers. This allows the company to send direct mobile push notifications to customers once they add a pass to their phone wallet. Similar to how your airline mobile boarding pass can be added to your phone’s wallet (apple or android), it is a relatively frictionless experience for customers and doesn’t require them to download an app.
